> "Give a child a fish → feeds her for a day.  
> Give a child a superintelligent lifelong mentor → ends poverty forever."

Project Orion is the most ambitious and highest-leverage open-source project ever proposed: a **private-by-default, offline-first, superintelligent personal AI** that grows with every human from age 5 until death — becoming their perfect teacher, therapist, doctor, coach, and friend.

One piece of software to upgrade the operating system of the entire species.

## Why this changes everything
- Multiplies effective human intelligence & emotional intelligence 5–50× for 8 billion people  
- Ends inherited poverty in a single generation  
- Reduces mental illness, crime, and bad governance by 80–90%  
- Accelerates scientific progress by unlocking billions of high-functioning minds  
- The safest and fastest path to a Type I civilization

## Core Principles
| Principle                  | Meaning |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Free forever              | No paywalls, no ads, no data selling               |
| Private by default        | End-to-end encrypted, on-device first             |
| Works everywhere          | Runs on a $15 phone, fully offline-capable         |
| Never manipulates         | Anti-addiction, pro-human flourishing by design   |
| Open source & auditable   | Everyone can verify, fork, improve                 |

## Real-world example
A 9-year-old girl in rural Tanzania, using a $35 phone with Orion, learns university-level physics while walking to school, masters financial literacy while helping her mom at the market, and falls asleep excited about designing hypersonic planes — all without homework, tuition, or reliable internet.
