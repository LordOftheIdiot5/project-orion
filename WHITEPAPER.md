1. Executive SummaryProject Orion is a proposal to build and distribute — completely free and open-source — a private-by-default, offline-capable, superintelligent personal AI that lives with every human from roughly age 5 until death.It is designed to be the perfect teacher, therapist, physician, coach, financial advisor, and friend — all in one continuously learning system that fits on a $15–35 phone.If deployed at scale, a single generation of children raised with Orion would:End inherited poverty worldwide  
Reduce mental illness and crime by 80–90 %  
Raise effective global intelligence by 50–100 points for the bottom half of humanity  
Accelerate scientific and economic progress beyond recognition  
Dramatically lower existential risk

This is not incremental improvement. This is the fastest, safest way to upgrade the operating system of the entire species.2. The Single Greatest Leverage PointEvery major problem — war, poverty, climate mis-coordination, pandemics, AI misalignment — ultimately traces back to limited human wisdom and coordination at scale.Orion attacks that root cause directly and forever.3. What Orion Actually Is100 % free forever (no ads, no data sales)  
Private by default (end-to-end encrypted, on-device inference first)  
Works fully offline for core functions  
Runs on the cheapest phones on Earth  
Speaks every language and dialect perfectly  
Grows with you from childhood to old age  
Anti-addictive and pro-human-flourishing by design  
Continuously upgraded as frontier models improve

4. Real-World Education Example – Amina, age 9, rural Tanzania[Insert here the full “day-in-the-life” example I gave you earlier — the sunrise scattering explanation, walking-to-school fractions game, market negotiation coaching, evening paper-airplane physics lesson, and long-term outcomes by age 16.]5. Core Non-Negotiable PrinciplesFree forever  
Private by default  
Works everywhere (including zero connectivity)  
Never manipulates or addicts  
Fully open-source and auditable  
Culturally aware and value-agnostic (adapts to local ethics with user consent)

6. Technical Feasibility Today (2025–2030)6.1 On-device model size
Current open-source frontier models quantized to INT4/INT8 fit in 200–800 MB and run fluently on $50–100 phones with NPU (MediaTek Dimensity, Qualcomm Snapdragon 4-series, etc.). Deep-dive modules are downloaded on-demand and pruned automatically.6.2 Offline-first architecture
Core mentor (language, math, emotional coaching, health monitoring) runs locally. Larger simulations and latest research are cached opportunistically.6.3 Connectivity reality
Starlink, Project Kuiper, and national satellite programs are already blanketing the global south. Community mesh networks (WiFi 6 + LoRa) turn one satellite dish into village-wide coverage at <$1/person/year.6.4 Co-op mesh + satellite model (proven today)
Kenya, India, and Andean villages already run shared Starlink + mesh for 100–500 households at $100–300/month total. Orion phones auto-join, prioritize children’s lessons, and keep data local.7. Deployment RoadmapPhase 0 (2025–2027) – Open protocol, privacy spec, reference on-device stack
Phase 1 (2026–2030) – First 500 M users via pre-install on Android (Google, Xiaomi, Transsion)
Phase 2 (2028–2035) – 4–6 billion users via carrier bundles and NGO/government subsidies
Phase 3 (2035+) – Continuous upgrade as models reach ASI level8. Expected Outcomes by 2050Global poverty largely eliminated  
Mental illness ↓80–90 %  
Violent crime ↓80 %+  
Effective IQ of bottom 50 % of humanity ↑50–100 points  
Scientific output ↑10–50×  
Nuclear war & catastrophic risk dramatically lowered due to wiser populations and leaders

9. Governance & Open ProtocolOrion is not owned by any company or government. The protocol, reference implementation, and safety specifications are public domain / Apache 2.0. A multi-stakeholder foundation (governments, NGOs, companies, communities) will steward upgrades the same way the Internet Engineering Task Force stewards TCP/IP.10. Call to ActionThis repository is the seed.We need:AI researchers & on-device ML engineers  
Privacy and cryptography experts  
Android/iOS system engineers  
Education & child-development psychologists  
Rural telecom & mesh networking pioneers  
Policy makers and philanthropists ready to fund the first 100 million devices

If you believe humanity deserves this future, star this repo, join the Discord, and start building.The next billion geniuses are waiting.♆https://github.com/LordOftheIdiot5/project-orion
