# About Project Orion

Project Orion is not just another AI assistant. It is the proposal for the single most impactful software system humanity could build in the 21st century.

We believe the root bottleneck of civilization is not energy, not capital, not even institutions — it is the limited cognitive and emotional bandwidth of individual humans.

Orion fixes that at the source.

By giving every single person on Earth a private, superintelligent, lifelong mentor that costs virtually nothing and works offline, we create the largest compounding force for good in history.

This repository is the seed. We are openly designing the protocol, privacy model, on-device architecture, and deployment playbook so that governments, NGOs, companies, and communities can build and ship it together — the way the internet itself was built.

If you believe humanity deserves an upgrade, you belong here.
